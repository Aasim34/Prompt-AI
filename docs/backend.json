    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to support the PromptForge AI application, focusing on user-generated prompts. The structure prioritizes authorization independence, clarity, and scalability. User data and prompts are segregated into separate collections with clear ownership. The primary goal is to create a secure and easily maintainable structure. Path-based ownership `/users/{userId}/prompts/{promptId}` is used because each prompt is owned by a specific user.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** Authorization independence is achieved by using path-based ownership. This design avoids `get()` calls in security rules, enhancing security and enabling atomic operations.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** The structure supports secure list operations (QAPs) by segregating user-owned data into collections. Rules can be applied at the collection level without needing to filter based on document data."
